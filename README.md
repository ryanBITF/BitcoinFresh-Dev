Bitcoin Fresh Core integration/staging repository
=================================================

Bitcoin Fresh (BITF) is a sustainable cryptocurrency with the vision to help those who do not have access to clean water. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency that is inspired by Bitcoin Green, which was designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. By harnessing their sustainable technology Bitcoin Fresh is able to help those in need while also allowing the coin to be mined by any computer.

- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus based advancement of the current Masternode
  technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with a collateral of 2,500 BITG.
